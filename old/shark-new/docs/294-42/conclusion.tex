\section{Conclusion}

We have presented Shark, a new data analysis system that combines the coarse-grained distributed shared-memory abstraction of RDDs with the Hive data warehouse. Our working prototype provides optimized execution of ad-hoc, exploratory queries that exploit inter-query temporal locality. In contrast to Hive and other data warehouse systems, Shark takes advantage of increasing RAM capacities to keep as much intermediate data in memory as possible, fundamentally accelerating query processing for similar queries or queries over the same dataset.
