Synthetic Data Generator
========================
This python script generates synthetic data for use with QuicksilverDB. It uses statistics from the following sources:

* Country statistics - http://www.internetworldstats.com/top20.htm
* City, zipcodes from MaxMind GeoCity-Lite
* Browser shares, OS shares from http://www.netmarketshare.com/

The database is SQLite, to see the tables, use SQLiteStudio (http://sqlitestudio.one.pl/)

To get help, run:

$ python main.py -h
